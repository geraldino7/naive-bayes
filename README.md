A Naive Bayes classifiers, a family of algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. Despite the “naive” assumption of feature independence, these classifiers are widely utilized for their simplicity and efficiency in machine learning. The article delves into theory, implementation, and applications, shedding light on their practical utility despite oversimplified assumptions.
